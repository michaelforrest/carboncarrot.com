## What if governments paid people to and businesses to take action on climate change?
We think the Global Carbon Reward is a game changer. It's a new financial mechanism that doesn't involve taxes. A positive market incentive for protecting the climate.

The reward is for reducing carbon emissions, for clean energy, for regenerative carbon farming, for protecting forests; it's a reward for doing good things that actually mitigate climate change.

This all costs a lot of money.

## How will governments find the trillions of dollars that are needed to save the planet?
Our idea is to use the power of money creation. Banks create money in ways taht are allowed under the law, and society can create new laws to protect the planet with money.

Here's how it goes: a business figures out a way to reduce emissions or pull carbon out of the atmosphere. The business is then rewarded with a new international currency, which we'll call "Carrot Coin". 

Based on an international political agreement, governments will instruct central banks to buy this currency so that no matter what happens, the exchange rate will slowly but surely rise.

This means that investors can add this currency to the low-risk end of their investment portfolio. It's a great new opportunity to make a healthy profit that is low-risk, socially responsible, and good for the planet.

Since the only way to mint more of this currency is to mitigate climate change, a virtuous economy is created because the the total mass of carbon that is mitigated will increase with the rising value of the currency.

## How does this fit in with The Paris Agreement?
If the carbon tax is a "stick" then the Global Carbon Reward is a "carrot". _[... it would be good to expand on this]_ This reward does not produce carbon offset credits and so it will redue net carbon emissions. The reward also complements other policies, including the Green New Deal. 

## What can I do?
Help us spread the word. Share this video and this website to introduce people to the concept of a Global Carbon Reward and use the #CarrotCoin hashtag on social media.
